        <h3> Introduction to the idea</h3>  
        <p>Reflected reality is designed to reveal the innate selfishness within each of us. Social provocation is utilized as a vehicle to confront individual selfishness in the face of other members of society that need resources more than ourselves. Making people aware of the underbelly of human selfishness that permeates our society, and realise that a minor selfish act can have a major impact on the lives of others.</p>
       
        <h3>Interacting with Reflected Reality</h3>
        <p>So how does our installation work? We’ve designed our interactive exhibit to work in the digital advertising panels that are integrated into bus-stops. 
        Our design challenges bus commuters to think about their own imprint on societal resources, and how their use of these resources can infringe on the needs of others, especially those who may need these resources more than themselves. </p>
         
        <p> When users sit down at the bus stop, a digital representation of an elderly, pregnant, or disabled commuter will approach them via the digital screen adjacent to the bus-stop seat. These speciality needs representations will direct the users attention, and ask them to stand up, so that they themselves may sit down.</p>
        
        <p>If the user does not pay attention, or ignores the representation, then the user is shown how their unwillingness to show altruism for others may have negative consequences. The elderly representation may fall over as there is no where to sit, or the pregnant representation may complain about how standing has hurt her back. </p>
         
        <h3>Design inspiration and Iteration</h3>
        <p>With this focus on human selfishness established, we searched for inspirations to help express our theme. We were inspired by successful advertising campaigns that persuasively employed interactive elements to challenge and shift viewpoints and behaviours. </p>
        
        <p>A paraplegic foundation successfully created an advertisment like this. It used optical illusion to give the impression that a bus-stop commuter was wheelchair bound. The action of the user getting up to catch a bus is then used to illustrate the desire of the foundation to see paraplegics walk again. 
        Like this design, We wanted our idea to create the same thought provoking effect on potential users, challenging their perceptions and promoting reflective thought.</p> 
        
        <p>Three iterations of the concept have been made. The concept originally was more of an interactiove animation. After feedback from user testing it was noted that the animation style was not powerful enough for the message at hand. Due to this and the research conducted the idea was changed to a more life like simulation.  </p>
